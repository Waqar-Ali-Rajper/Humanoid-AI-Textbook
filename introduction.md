# Introduction

Title: Introduction to Physical AI

Physical AI builds systems that sense the world and act in it. These systems run AI models, understand physics, and interact with people. You learn how digital intelligence connects to a physical body.

You study humanoid robots because they match human environments. Doors, stairs, tables, tools, all follow human design. A humanoid robot fits into this world.

You follow a full pipeline.

Sense the world

Process data

Plan actions

Control motors

Use AI for perception and reasoning

You work with ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac. You build your own digital twin. You test behaviors in simulation before deployment. You learn modern Vision Language Action systems.

By the end, you know how to build a robot that listens, plans, and acts.
