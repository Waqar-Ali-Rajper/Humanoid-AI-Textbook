Title: Physical AI Concepts

Physical AI focuses on embodied intelligence. The system links sensors, AI models, and actuators.

Core ideas

Embodiment: AI connects to a physical body

Perception: camera, depth, IMU, force sensors

Action: motors, joints, controllers

Learning: navigation, grasping, balance

Sim-to-real: train in simulation and deploy on hardware

Why humanoids matter

Human-centered spaces

Existing data from human actions

Ready access to training environments

Natural interaction with people

Key outcomes

Understand robot bodies

Build perception pipelines

Link AI models to motion

Control robots with ROS 2

Build safe, testable behaviors in simulation
