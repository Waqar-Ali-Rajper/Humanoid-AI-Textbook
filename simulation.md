Title: Simulation with Gazebo and Unity

You build a digital twin to test robots before deployment. Simulation saves cost and reduces hardware risk.

Gazebo

Physics engine

Collision, gravity, friction simulation

Sensor simulation for camera, depth, LIDAR

Robot models using URDF and SDF

Unity

High-quality visuals

Human interaction environments

UI tools for complex scenes

Workflow

Load robot in Gazebo

Add sensors

Test locomotion

Validate balance

Build Unity scene for interaction

Connect ROS 2 bridge for data flow

Simulation prepares you for NVIDIA Isaac and real-world deployment.
